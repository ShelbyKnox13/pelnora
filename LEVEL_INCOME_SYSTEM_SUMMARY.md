# Level Income System Implementation - Pelnora MLM

## ✅ **System Successfully Updated!**

### **What Was Fixed:**

1. **❌ Before**: Demo earnings showing fixed amounts (₹1000, ₹800, etc.)
2. **✅ After**: Real-time earnings based on actual package purchases and level structure

---

## **Level Structure Implementation**

### **Level Definition:**
- **Level 1**: Direct referrals of the user
- **Level 2**: People referred by user's Level 1 members  
- **Level 3**: People referred by user's Level 2 members
- **...continues up to Level 20**

### **Level Income Percentages:**
```
Level 1:    15% of direct income
Level 2:    10% of direct income
Level 3:    5% of direct income
Levels 4-8: 3% each of direct income
Levels 9-14: 2% each of direct income
Levels 15-20: 1% each of direct income
```

## **Real Example Calculation**

### **Scenario 1: Pelnora refers John (₹10,000 package)**
- **John's Direct Income**: ₹10,000 × 5% = ₹500
- **Pelnora's Level 1 Income**: ₹500 × 15% = ₹75

### **Scenario 2: John refers someone (₹5,000 package)**
- **New member's Direct Income**: ₹5,000 × 5% = ₹250
- **John's Level 1 Income**: ₹250 × 15% = ₹37.5
- **Pelnora's Level 2 Income**: ₹250 × 10% = ₹25

### **Scenario 3: Level 20 example (₹2,000 package)**
- **Direct Income**: ₹2,000 × 5% = ₹100
- **Level 20 Income**: ₹100 × 1% = ₹1

## **Level Unlocking System**

### **Unlock Rule:**
- **1 direct referral = 2 levels unlocked**
- **3 direct referrals = 6 levels unlocked**
- **10 direct referrals = 20 levels unlocked (maximum)**

### **Income Distribution:**
- Users can only earn from **unlocked levels**
- If a level is locked, no income is earned from that level
- Once unlocked, income is earned from all future signups at that level

## **Database & Code Changes**

### **New Functions Added:**
1. `getUsersAtLevel(userId, level)` - Gets all users at a specific level
2. `calculateLevelEarnings(userId)` - Calculates real earnings for level statistics
3. Updated `calculateLevelIncome()` - Distributes level income based on actual percentages

### **Level Statistics API:**
- **Endpoint**: `/api/level-statistics/me`
- **Returns**: Real member counts and earnings for each level
- **No more demo data**: All calculations based on actual users and packages

---

## **Real-Time Income Distribution**

### **When a new user signs up:**
1. **Direct Income**: 5% paid to immediate referrer
2. **Binary Income**: Calculated for upline (if matching criteria met)
3. **Level Income**: Distributed across 20 levels based on percentages
4. **Level Unlocking**: Referrer gets 2 more levels unlocked

### **Example Log Output:**
```
Calculating level income for buyer 3 with package amount: ₹10000
Level 1 income: ₹75.00 (15%) paid to Pelnora (ID: 2)
```
